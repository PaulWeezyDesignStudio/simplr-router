# Getting started >> Using a starter || 20

Simplr Router was built to work with Web Component environments and therefore the [Open-WC starter](https://open-wc.org/guides/developing-components/getting-started/)
is a perfect base for using this router.


## Initial setup

Start by initializing your project with the Open-WC starter

```bash
npm init @open-wc
```

This will prompt you to generate a starter application for your web component project. You should choose to create
an application, and add whatever optional tooling you need.

## Installing the router

```bash
npm install @simplr-wc/router
```

This command will install the Simplr Router to your project and will be ready to use as soon as it's finished installing.
