This has the potential of saving a lot\nof time in your page's initial load times. \nIn a regular routing situation, your routing file might look something like this: \nimport  {  SimplrRouter  }  from  \"@simplr-wc/router\" ; \nimport  {  SimplrRouterDemo  }  from  \"./SimplrRouterDemo.js\" ; \nimport  \"./ExampleView.js\" ; \n\ncustomElements. define ( \"simplr-router-demo\" ,  SimplrRouterDemo ) ; \n\nconst  routes =  [ \n    {  path:  \"\" ,  component:  \"simplr-router-demo\"  } , \n    {  path:  \"example\" ,  component:  \"example-view\"  } \n] ; \n\nconst  router =  new  SimplrRouter ( {  routes } ) ; \nrouter. init ( ) ; \n  \nTo enable lazy loading, remove the import statements of the views you want to load lazily from the\ntop of the file, and add them as properties to your routes: \nimport  {  SimplrRouter  }  from  \"@simplr-wc/router\" ; \nimport  {  SimplrRouterDemo  }  from  \"./SimplrRouterDemo.js\" ; \n\ncustomElements. define ( \"simplr-router-demo\" ,  SimplrRouterDemo ) ; \n\nconst  routes =  [ \n    {  path:  \"\" ,  component:  \"simplr-router-demo\"  } , \n    {  path:  \"example\" ,  component:  \"example-view\" ,  import :  ( )  =>  import ( \"./ExampleView.js\" )  } \n] ; \n\nconst  router =  new  SimplrRouter ( {  routes } ) ; \nrouter. init ( ) ; \n  \nNow the view is only imported as the page is loaded, reducing initial load on your web app.\nIt goes without saying that this might have magnitudes of effect on web applications where you have a large\ncollections of views.","section":"guides"},"dr":{"title":"Recipes: Lazy loading","headline":"Bundlers","body":"Due to the nature of the import being in code, most bundlers should be able to grasp onto the import statement\nand bundle it correctly, even if the file gets renamed. \n\n  \n    \n  \n    Caught a mistake or want to contribute to the documentation?\n    Edit this page on GitHub!","section":"guides"},"ds":{"title":"Recipes: Named routes","headline":"Recipes: Named routes","body":"Sometimes refering to the routes by the full path might be cumbersome, and you would father navigate using the\nname of the path.
